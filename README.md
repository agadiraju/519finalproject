===============

So far I tried Naive Bayes and Neural Networks. They both fail for the same reason -- the # of bikes taken out can be anywhere
from 0 to 997. It's too broad of a classification to make.

RMSLE sigmoid =  3.99758669678
RMSLE linear =  2.85748622823
RMSLE rbf =  3.87239506429
RMSLE rbf with C=5 gamma=0.0001 = 3.48305326784
